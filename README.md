# Meme Machine

## Current Version: v0.2 BETA

## Overview

The Meme Machine is a semi-private repository of memes that can be easily searched, indexed, and accessed anywhere at any time. Content is not limited to memes, either. Reaction images and gifs, cancerous stuff, friends/members-related stuff, fails, replies, anything, really. It's mostly here for organization and access. This is the source code.

## Running

Clone the repository to the root (or other subdirectory) of your website. Change the appropriate files so that your database is being accessed with your credentials. Make a folder called "uploads" or change the code to suit your needs
